				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A gravity simulation using CRT style vector graphics. Click the screen to create new objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I keep track of a list of the positions, velocities, and sizes of objects in a list.
					Then, each frame, I apply Newton's equation for gravity to each of the objects in
					order to change their velocities, then move each of them by a step based on their
					new velocity. This results in a good approximation of gravity, but without any forces
					keeping them apart they all just fall towards each other immediately. To fix this, both
					the objects and the gravitational forces wrap around the edges of the screen, the same
					way Pac-Man does when you go off one side of the level. This keeps the objects apart in
					a more natural way and approximates what it would be like if the simulation was infinite.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I enjoyed this experiment as I find both physics simulations and vector graphics to
					be really interesting. I was surprised how easy it was to get the graphics and
					simulation to a working state, but how hard it was to find ways to keep the simulation
					from either collapsing in on itself or exploding off the sides of the screen. One
					interesting problem I faced early on was that, as a result of not having object
					collision implemented, objects would become unrealistically close together and the
					forces would throw them off the screen at crazy speeds.</p>
